* Assign little bit-len to big bit-len
** From int to char
#+begin_src C
  int i = 0x123456789;
  char c = 0x33;

  i = c;
#+end_src
will be translated as
#+begin_src asm
  mov i, 0x123456789
  mov c, 0x33

  movsx eax, c
  mov i, eax
#+end_src


*Note*
- as most, one optor can be mem. if wanting mov from mem to mem, reg should
  used as bridge.

*Info*
- W4 in VS warns, if assigning big bit-len to little bit-len.


** From int to char with unsign-cast
#+begin_src C
  int i = 0x123456789;
  char c = 0x33;

  i = (unsigned char)c;
#+end_src
will be translated as
#+begin_src asm
  mov i, 0x123456789
  mov c, 0x33

  movzx eax, c
  mov i, eax
#+end_src
