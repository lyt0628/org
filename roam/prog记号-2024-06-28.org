    Every position devided by ,
    i.e.
    - [0,!0]: Functions will return 0 when success, and any unknown number but not zero
  - result used = to indicate
    - [errno=ESRCH] indicates a case the errno is assigned to ESRCH
  - : can be used to explain why the result happened
    [errno=ESRCH:no Proc else no Auth]
  - [] can be embbbed
    i.e.
    - [0,-1[errno=ESRCH:no Proc else no Auth]] means 0 when successed, -1 when failed.
      errno will be set as ESRCH, which means Dest_Proc not exists or Caller has no auth
      to do it
