We can Embbed ASM in C/C++ Code.
When compiling, the ASM code will be put in bin file directly.
We needs a macro to tell compiler that the code is Embbed ASM.
The macro is various depenting on compiler.

- In VS Compiler
#+begin_src C
  __asm mov aaa, 0x778899

  __asm
  {
	mov aaa, 0x778899
  	mov bbb, 0x778899
  }
#+end_src

- In GCC
#+begin_src C
  __asm move aaa, 0x778899
  __asm move aaa, 0x778899
  __ASM move aaa, 0x778899
  __ASM__ move aaa, 0x778899
#+end_src
